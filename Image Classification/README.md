# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with CNN Architectures

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of four well-known Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures—LeNet, AlexNet, VGGNet, and GoogleNet—on the CIFAR-10 dataset for image classification. The notebook walks through the following steps:

1. **Data Processing and Augmentation**  
   Preprocessing the CIFAR-10 dataset and applying data augmentation techniques to enhance model performance.

2. **Model Implementation**  
   Building and training the LeNet, AlexNet, VGGNet, and GoogleNet architectures on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

3. **Model Evaluation**  
   Testing and comparing the performance of each architecture on the CIFAR-10 dataset to identify the most effective model.

4. **Inference**  
   Using the best-performing model to make predictions on images not included in the CIFAR-10 dataset.
